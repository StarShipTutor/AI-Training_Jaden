## ChatGPT Main Page
[Parent Page](Models)

ChatGPT is the primary general-purpose reasoning engine used in this training program.

It is built by **OpenAI** and serves as:

- A reasoning partner  
- A writing assistant  
- A coding assistant  
- A structured thinking tool  
- A coordination layer for agents and tools  

In this program, ChatGPT is treated as a **cognitive amplifier**, not an authority.

## What ChatGPT Is

ChatGPT is a large language model that can:

- Analyze text
- Generate structured writing
- Assist with coding
- Help scaffold financial and market models
- Support structured decision-making
- Coordinate multi-step reasoning tasks

It works best when given clear instructions, structured context, and explicit goals.

---

## What ChatGPT Is Not

- It is **not always correct**.
- It does **not replace domain expertise**.
- It does **not know your business context** unless you provide it.
- It will confidently amplify incorrect assumptions.
- It does not independently verify facts unless explicitly instructed.

All outputs must be treated as drafts requiring human review.

## Primary Use Cases in This Program

Within AI Training (Commercial Real Estate focus), ChatGPT is used for:

- Structured writing and analysis  
- Market modeling drafts  
- Financial modeling logic scaffolding  
- Deal analysis frameworks  
- Coding assistance (Python, Excel logic, automation)  
- Summarizing research and documents  
- Agent design and orchestration  
- Creating presentations and training materials  

ChatGPT is a productivity multiplier when used with discipline.

## Strengths

- Strong general reasoning  
- Excellent coding assistance  
- Structured analytical writing  
- Rapid iteration and refinement  
- Custom GPT creation  
- API integration for automation  
- Broad ecosystem support  

---

## Weaknesses

- Can hallucinate facts  
- Sensitive to ambiguous prompts  
- May produce plausible but incorrect financial logic  
- Context window limitations  
- Requires structured inputs for best results  
- Does not automatically detect flawed assumptions  

Improper use can amplify errors rather than reduce them.

## Our Operating Method

We do not use ChatGPT as a simple question-answer machine.

We use it through:

- Structured prompting  
- Context engineering  
- GRS-TDD (Given → Required → Assumptions → Solution)  
- Iterative refinement  
- Explicit assumption checking  
- Human verification  

The goal is not speed alone — it is disciplined cognitive leverage.

---

## Governance Notes

- Do not upload confidential client data without authorization.  
- Treat outputs as working drafts, not final authority.  
- Maintain human oversight on financial and investment decisions.  
- Document key assumptions when using AI-assisted analysis.  

AI should support professional judgment — not replace it.

## Position in the AI Stack

ChatGPT is our primary general reasoning engine.

Other models may be used for:

- Long-context analysis (e.g., Claude)  
- Workspace integration (e.g., Gemini)  
- Web-grounded research (e.g., Perplexity)  

Tool choice should be task-driven, not brand-driven.

## Starting Recommendation

New users should begin by:

1. Using ChatGPT for structured summaries.
2. Practicing clear, explicit prompts.
3. Asking it to state assumptions.
4. Validating all outputs.
5. Applying it to one real-world task weekly.

Mastery comes from deliberate use, not casual experimentation.
