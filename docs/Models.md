# AI Models

## Important Distinctions

- A **Company** builds AI systems (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
- A **Model** is the underlying reasoning engine (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 1.5).
- A **Platform** is where you interact with the model (ChatGPT app, Claude app, Gemini in Docs).
- An **API** allows developers to embed models into other software.

There is no single "best" model. 
Different models are optimized for different strengths:
- Reasoning
- Coding
- Long context analysis
- Multimodal (images, audio)
- Web-grounded research
## Recommended Models

These are the highly recommended commercially available models.  
They each have their own platforms and can be embedded in other tools as well.

### ChatGPT - [Page](ChatGPT-Main-Page)
- **Owner:** OpenAI  
- **Best Use:** General-purpose reasoning, structured writing, coding assistance, and agent orchestration.  
- **Description:** A frontier large language model platform optimized for reasoning, tool use, coding, document drafting, and multi-step problem solving. Strong ecosystem support including custom GPTs, API access, and enterprise-grade deployments.

---

### Claude - [Page](Claude-Main-Page)
- **Owner:** Anthropic  
- **Best Use:** Long-document analysis, policy drafting, safety-conscious workflows, and structured business writing.  
- **Description:** A large language model designed with a strong emphasis on constitutional AI and safety. Particularly effective for long context windows, document synthesis, and thoughtful analytical writing.

---

### Gemini - [Page](Gemini-Main-Page)
- **Owner:** Google  
- **Best Use:** Integration with Google Workspace, multimodal tasks, and enterprise productivity environments.  
- **Description:** A multimodal large language model integrated deeply into Google’s ecosystem (Docs, Sheets, Gmail, etc.). Strong for productivity augmentation, research, and cross-format reasoning.

### Perplexity - [Page](Perplexity-Main-Page)
- **Owner:** Perplexity AI  
- **Best Use:** Web-grounded research, citation-backed summaries, and rapid topic exploration.  
- **Description:** A research-oriented AI platform that combines large language models with live web retrieval to produce citation-supported answers. Particularly useful for fact-finding and discovery workflows.

## Not Trusted Models

These are models or categories that are **not recommended** due to trust, reliability, geopolitical risk, or alignment concerns.

---

### Chinese Models
- **Owner:** Various Chinese AI companies (e.g., Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent)  
- **Notes:** Potential regulatory influence from the Chinese government, data governance concerns, and alignment constraints that may conflict with Western enterprise compliance or privacy standards.

---

### Grok
- **Owner:** xAI  
- **Notes:** Rapid iteration model integrated into social media platforms. Concerns include inconsistent reliability, limited enterprise governance controls, and higher volatility in outputs compared to more mature enterprise platforms.

---

### Others
- **Owner:** Varies  
- **Notes:** Any model lacking clear enterprise governance, documented safety alignment processes, transparent ownership, or API stability should be evaluated cautiously before production use.
