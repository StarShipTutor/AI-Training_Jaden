## Prompting AIs
[Parent Page](Home)

This is just to provide a starting point for prompting AIs. We will do much more as we work through the training.

Prompting ( Prompt Engineering ) is the practice of giving clear, structured instructions to an AI model in order to produce useful, reliable outputs.

AI models do not “understand” intent the way humans do. They respond to patterns in language. The quality of the output depends heavily on the clarity, structure, and completeness of the input.

In this program, prompting is treated as a professional skill — not casual conversation.

## Be Explicit

Do not assume the model understands your goals, constraints, or definitions.

Clearly state:
- The objective
- The format required
- The level of detail
- The intended audience
- Any constraints or assumptions

Ambiguity leads to unpredictable results.

## Provide Context

Models do not retain institutional memory unless you provide it.

Include:
- Relevant background information
- Definitions of terms
- Data inputs
- Business constraints
- Assumptions already made

Better context produces more stable outputs.

## Specify the Output Format

If you want:
- A table
- Bullet points
- Markdown
- A financial model outline
- A step-by-step explanation

Say so explicitly.

Structured outputs reduce cleanup work and increase reliability.

## Ask for Assumptions

Models often fill in missing information silently.

Explicitly request:
- “List all assumptions you are making.”
- “Identify areas of uncertainty.”
- “Highlight where data is missing.”

This prevents hidden errors in financial or analytical work.

## Break Down Complex Tasks

Large requests should be divided into smaller steps.

Instead of:
“Analyze this deal.”

Use:
1. Summarize the deal.
2. Identify key risks.
3. Model cash flow structure.
4. Provide sensitivity scenarios.

Stepwise prompting increases clarity and accuracy.

## Iterate Deliberately

The first output is rarely the final answer.

Refine by:
- Clarifying errors
- Narrowing scope
- Requesting deeper explanation
- Reformatting outputs

Prompting is iterative collaboration, not one-shot execution.

---

## Verify Critical Outputs

Never rely on AI without validation.

Particularly in:
- Financial modeling
- Investment analysis
- Legal summaries
- Market data

AI can produce plausible but incorrect results. Human oversight is mandatory.

## Prompting Philosophy

Good prompting is disciplined thinking made explicit.

The goal is not to “trick” the model.
The goal is to structure thought clearly enough that the model can assist effectively.

Clear thinking produces clear prompts.
Clear prompts produce better outcomes.
