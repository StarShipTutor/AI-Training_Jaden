## Perplexity Main Page
[Parent Page](Models)

Perplexity is a research-focused AI platform designed to combine large language models with live web retrieval.

It is built by **Perplexity AI** and serves as:

- A web-grounded research assistant  
- A citation-backed summary tool  
- A discovery engine for new topics  
- A rapid briefing generator  
- A current-events research layer  

In this program, Perplexity is treated as a **research and discovery tool**, not a reasoning authority.

## What Perplexity Is

Perplexity is an AI system optimized for:

- Searching the web in real time  
- Producing answers with citations  
- Summarizing news and reports  
- Generating research overviews  
- Exploring unfamiliar topics quickly  

It is strongest when the task requires **current information or external references**.

---

## What Perplexity Is Not

- It is **not a primary reasoning engine**.  
- It does **not replace primary source verification**.  
- It may cite weak or secondary sources.  
- It can misinterpret or over-compress nuanced material.  
- It does not understand your business context unless explicitly stated.

Citations improve transparency but do not guarantee correctness.

## Primary Use Cases in This Program

Within AI Training (Commercial Real Estate focus), Perplexity is used for:

- Researching market trends  
- Identifying recent news affecting asset classes  
- Finding regulatory updates  
- Locating industry reports  
- Building initial research briefs  
- Discovering new tools, companies, or competitors  

Perplexity is ideal for **rapid orientation and fact-finding**.

## Strengths

- Web-grounded responses  
- Inline citations  
- Fast topic exploration  
- Useful for discovering primary sources  
- Good starting point for unfamiliar domains  

---

## Weaknesses

- Dependent on available web sources  
- May surface low-quality or biased material  
- Limited deep reasoning compared to primary models  
- Over-compression of complex topics  
- Citation presence does not equal validation  

It is a starting point, not a final authority.

## Our Operating Method

We use Perplexity to gather external context before deeper analysis.

Our approach includes:

- Requesting citation-backed summaries  
- Checking the credibility of linked sources  
- Following primary sources when possible  
- Cross-verifying important claims  
- Moving to ChatGPT or Claude for structured reasoning  

Perplexity helps us find information — it does not replace judgment.

---

## Governance Notes

- Verify all cited data before operational use.  
- Avoid relying on single-source conclusions.  
- Confirm publication dates and source credibility.  
- Maintain human oversight before integrating findings into financial models.  

Research discipline remains essential.

## Position in the AI Stack

Perplexity is our primary **web-grounded research layer**.

Other models may be used for:

- Deep reasoning and structured modeling (ChatGPT)  
- Long-document synthesis (Claude)  
- Workspace-integrated drafting (Gemini)  

We separate **research retrieval** from **analytical reasoning**.

## Starting Recommendation

New users should begin by:

1. Asking for a citation-backed overview of a topic.  
2. Reviewing the sources directly.  
3. Comparing multiple cited sources.  
4. Bringing findings into a structured reasoning model (ChatGPT or Claude).  
5. Using it weekly for market awareness updates.

Perplexity accelerates research — but verification remains human.
