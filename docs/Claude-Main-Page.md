## Claude Main Page
[Parent Page](Models)

Claude is Anthropic’s general-purpose AI reasoning engine, designed with a strong emphasis on safety, structured thinking, and long-context analysis.

It is built by **Anthropic** and serves as:

- A long-document analysis partner  
- A policy and memo drafting assistant  
- A structured reasoning tool  
- A research synthesis assistant  
- A cautious analytical collaborator  

In this program, Claude is treated as a **deep analysis engine**, particularly useful for long, complex documents.

## What Claude Is

Claude is a large language model optimized for:

- Long-context document review  
- Structured analytical writing  
- Policy drafting  
- Careful reasoning over complex material  
- Synthesizing large volumes of information  

It is especially effective when working with long PDFs, contracts, research papers, or multi-document analysis.

---

## What Claude Is Not

- It is **not immune to errors or hallucinations**.  
- It does **not replace legal, financial, or domain expertise**.  
- It does **not automatically verify data accuracy**.  
- It may produce cautious but still incorrect conclusions.  
- It does not understand your organization’s constraints unless explicitly stated.

All outputs must be reviewed by a qualified professional.

## Primary Use Cases in This Program

Within AI Training (Commercial Real Estate focus), Claude is used for:

- Reviewing long lease agreements  
- Summarizing market research reports  
- Analyzing investment memos  
- Drafting structured policy documents  
- Synthesizing multi-source research  
- Breaking down complex regulatory or legal text  

Claude excels when the task involves **depth over speed**.

## Strengths

- Strong long-context handling  
- Thoughtful and structured writing style  
- Effective document summarization  
- Good at outlining complex arguments  
- Emphasis on safety-conscious responses  

---

## Weaknesses

- Slower iterative workflow compared to rapid chat models  
- May be overly cautious in some business contexts  
- Can still hallucinate references  
- Limited direct integration into mainstream productivity tools  
- Requires explicit direction for numerical or financial precision  

Claude should not be relied on without verification of critical details.

## Our Operating Method

We use Claude for structured, document-heavy workflows.

Our approach includes:

- Uploading full documents for context  
- Asking for structured outlines first  
- Requesting assumption identification  
- Iterative refinement  
- Independent verification of factual claims  

Claude is used for clarity and synthesis — not final authority.

---

## Governance Notes

- Do not upload confidential contracts without authorization.  
- Verify all summarized financial terms against source documents.  
- Confirm that regulatory interpretations are validated externally.  
- Maintain human approval before distributing AI-generated analyses.  

AI assists professional review — it does not replace it.

## Position in the AI Stack

Claude is our primary **long-context and policy analysis engine**.

Other models may be used for:

- Rapid reasoning and coding (ChatGPT)  
- Google Workspace integration (Gemini)  
- Web-grounded research (Perplexity)  

We select tools based on task requirements.

## Starting Recommendation

New users should begin by:

1. Uploading a long document and requesting a structured outline.  
2. Asking Claude to list assumptions made in the document.  
3. Requesting a summary tailored to a specific audience.  
4. Verifying key numerical or contractual terms manually.  
5. Applying it to one complex document per week.

Claude is most valuable when working through material that would otherwise take hours to review.
